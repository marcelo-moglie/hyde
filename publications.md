In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

	abstract = {“Growing old” is the most common cause of hearing loss. Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) (presbycusis) first affects the ability to understand speech in background noise, even when auditory thresholds in quiet are normal. It has been suggested that cochlear denervation (“synaptopathy”) is an early contributor to age-related auditory decline. In the present work, we characterized age-related cochlear synaptic degeneration and hair cell loss in mice with enhanced α9α10 cholinergic nicotinic receptors gating kinetics (“gain of function” nAChRs). These mediate inhibitory olivocochlear feedback through the activation of associated calcium-gated potassium channels. Cochlear function was assessed via distortion product otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses. Cochlear structure was characterized in immunolabeled organ of Corti whole mounts using confocal microscopy to quantify hair cells, auditory neurons, presynaptic ribbons, and postsynaptic glutamate receptors. Aged wild-type mice had elevated acoustic thresholds and synaptic loss. Afferent synapses were lost from inner hair cells throughout the aged cochlea, together with some loss of outer hair cells. In contrast, cochlear structure and function were preserved in aged mice with gain-of-function nAChRs that provide enhanced olivocochlear inhibition, suggesting that efferent feedback is important for long-term maintenance of inner ear function. Our work provides evidence that olivocochlear-mediated resistance to presbycusis-ARHL occurs via the α9α10 nAChR complexes on outer hair cells. Thus, enhancement of the medial olivocochlear system could be a viable strategy to prevent age-related hearing loss.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            The lateral line (LL) is a sensory system that allows fish and amphibians to detect water currents. LL responsiveness to external stimuli is modulated by descending efferent neurons. LL efferent modulation aids the animal to distinguish between external and self-generated stimuli, maintaining sensitivity to relevant cues. One of the main components of the efferent system is cholinergic, the activation of which inhibits afferent activity. Since LL hair cells (HC) share structural, functional and molecular similarities with those of the cochlea, one could propose that the receptor at the LL efferent synapse is a α9α10 nicotinic cholinergic one (nAChR). However, the identity of the molecular players underlying acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated inhibition in the LL remain unknown. Surprisingly, through the analysis of single-cell expression data and
            in situ
            hybridization, we describe that α9, but not α10 subunits, are enriched in zebrafish HC. Moreover, the heterologous expression of zebrafish α9 subunits indicates that α9 homomeric receptors are functional and exhibit robust ACh-gated currents which are blocked by α-Bungarotoxin (α-Btx). In addition,

            Ca
            2+
            imaging on mechanically-stimulated zebrafish LL HC showed that ACh elicits a decrease in evoked Ca
            2+
            signals, irrespective of HC polarity. This effect was blocked by both α-Btx and apamin, indicating coupling of ACh mediated effects to SK potassium channels. Collectively, our results indicate that an α9-containing (α9*) nAChR operates at the zebrafish LL efferent synapse. Moreover, the activation of α9* nAChRs most likely leads to LL HC hyperpolarization served by the ACh-dependent activation of Ca
            2+
            -dependent SK potassium channels.
          
          
            Significance Statement
            
              Fishes and amphibians have a mechanosensory system, the lateral line (LL), which serves to detect hydromechanical variations around the animal’s body. The LL receives descending efferent innervation from the brain that modulates its responsiveness to external stimuli. LL efferent inhibition is mediated by ACh, however the identity of the molecular players at the LL efferent synapse is unknown. Here we demonstrate that a nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) composed of α9 subunits operates at the LL efferent synapse. Activation of α9-containing (α9*) nAChRs leads to LL hair cell hyperpolarization. The inhibitory signature of this process is brought about by the subsequent activation of Ca
              2+
              -dependent potassium SK channels, functionally coupled to α9* nAChRs.},

	abstract = {The α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays a fundamental role in inner ear physiology. It mediates synaptic transmission between efferent olivocochlear fibers that descend from the brainstem and hair cells of the auditory sensory epithelium. The α9 and α10 subunits have undergone a distinct evolutionary history within the family of nAChRs. Predominantly in mammalian vertebrates, the α9α10 receptor has accumulated changes at the protein level that may ultimately relate to the evolutionary history of the mammalian hearing organ. In the present work we investigated the responses of α9α10 nAChRs to choline, the metabolite of acetylcholine degradation at the synaptic cleft. Whereas choline is a full agonist of chicken α9α10 receptors it is a partial agonist of the rat receptor. Making use of the expression of α9α10 heterologous receptors, encompassing wild-type, heteromeric, homomeric, mutant, chimeric and hybrid receptors, and in silico molecular docking, we establish that the mammalian (rat) α10 nAChR subunit underscores the reduced efficacy of choline. Moreover, we show that whereas the complementary face of the α10 subunit does not play an important role in the activation of the receptor by ACh, it is strictly required for choline responses. Thus, we propose that the evolutionary changes acquired in the mammalian α9α10 nAChR resulted in the loss of choline acting as a full agonist at the efferent synapse, without affecting the triggering of ACh responses. This may have accompanied the fine-tuning of hair cell post-synaptic responses to the high frequency activity of efferent medial olivocochlear fibers that modulate the cochlear amplifier.},
